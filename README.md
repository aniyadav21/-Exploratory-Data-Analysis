# ðŸ›³ Titanic Dataset â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.  
The goal is to identify trends, patterns, and correlations related to passenger survival.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **train.csv** â€“ Passenger details, including demographic and travel information.
- Target variable: `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## ðŸ“Š Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Inspection** â€“ Checked structure, missing values, and data types.
2. **Univariate Analysis** â€“ Survival count, age distribution, fare distribution.
3. **Bivariate Analysis** â€“ Survival by sex, class, age, and embarkation port.
4. **Correlation Analysis** â€“ Heatmap showing relationships between numeric features.
5. **Observations & Insights** â€“ Documented patterns from the visualizations.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure `train.csv` is in the same folder as `EDA_Titanic.ipynb`.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter and **Run All Cells**.
